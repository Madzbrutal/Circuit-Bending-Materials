# Circuit Bending in the Classroom

## What is Circuit Bending?

Circuit bending is the creative practice of modifying the internal circuitry of electronic devices to create new sounds or functionalities that weren't originally intended. This is typically done by exposing the circuit board and experimenting with connections to discover "glitches" or unpredictable outcomes. It's a form of hardware hacking that embraces chance and improvisation.

## Circuit Bending as Digital Humanities Research

Circuit bending is an excellent tool for the digital humanities classroom because it encourages hands-on engagement with technology, fostering a deeper understanding of the materiality behind digital systems. By experimenting with circuit bending, students can explore the unpredictable and often hidden potentials within electronic devices, gaining insight into how technology can be repurposed and reimagined. This practice invites critical thinking about the construction of digital tools, revealing how systems can be hacked, subverted, or redefined. Takeaways for students include a stronger grasp of the intersection between art, technology, and culture, along with skills in creative problem-solving, technological literacy, and an appreciation for the unexpected possibilities within digital media.

## How to Circuit Bend

Anything can be circuit bent, and often experimental musicians and glitch artists will construct elaborate glitch consoles. This involves soldering circuit boards and installing new switches to the system. While this can be an extremely rewarding experience, it is logistically difficult to engage this kind of circuit bending, called "hard bending," in a classroom setting. Instead, I offer two examples of in-class workshops and assignments I run in undergraduate media courses.

### Circuit Reading Project.

In this assignment inspired by Nina Belojevics work, stuents experiment with circuit bending by learning to "read" an NES circuit board and creating glitches. Students lear to "soft bend," or create new circuits on the fly. This allows them to experiment and learn how the system works on a hardware level, while treating the circuit board like a controller. I ask students to reflect on how technological systems can be reconfigured and repurposed, revealing limits and possibilities.

### Bibliocircuitry

Students can also learn to add circuitry to other non-digital media by adding electronic components such as circuits and LED lights to poetic creations. Inspired by Charity Hancock, et al., this integration aims to explore new dimensions of artistic expression by combining traditional paper media with interactive technology. This assignment not only challenges students to think creatively about the use of technology in art but also to reflect deeply on how such integration can redefine the boundaries of media technologies. This project also has the distinct advantage that it engages repurposing media without having to dismantle retro gaming equipment or haul CRT televisions.

PDFs for both assignments can be found accompanying this file.
